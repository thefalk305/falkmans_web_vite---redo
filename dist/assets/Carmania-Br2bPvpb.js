The R.M.S. Carmania was powered by the then innovative Parson's steam turbine engines, which offered higher speeds, simpler maintenance and best of all, lower operational costs. Thus she was effectively the test ship for operating a turbine engine on a large passenger liner, whilst her sister, the R.M.S. Caronia was operated by the more traditional quadruple-expansion steam engines. These very different systems were installed purposely as it was done to test the effectiveness of these two systems, and which would be the most effective for the future. Another feature that differentiated the two sister ships was that "Carmania" had two tall forward deck ventilator cowls, which the "Caronia" did not have. But there was something else about these two fine sister ships, for at the time they where the largest and fastest liners in the Cunard fleet.
